# theImmanuelBible
The translation of the Immanuel Bible is organized and created under the authorship and authority of the Emissary of the Immanuel United church, under the testament and authority also of its church members worldwide. Its editing, authorizations, and its preservation are monitored and overseen by the Emissary, his council of cardinals, the Bishopry, the council of the Shekhinar-Gittioni Priesthood, and the corporate powers of the many members of Immanuel United.
